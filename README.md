Quantitative Precipitation Estimation Projects for Taiwan Area

## Quantitative Precipitation Estimation with Deep Neural Networks
In this project, we aim to develop an operational system that employs data-driven approach to perform predictions of quantitative precipitation in the Taipei area. Specifically, this system leverages deep neural network using RADAR, re-analysis, and sounding data as input to predict precipitation in real-time and in 1hr, 3hr, 6hr, 12hr, and 24hr time lag.
